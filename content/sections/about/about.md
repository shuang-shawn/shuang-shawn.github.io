## 👋 About Me

I'm a **cloud enthusiast**, 🎮 **gaming nerd**, and **modern tech explorer** who enjoys solving problems almost as much as I enjoy creating them (purely for testing purposes, of course 😅).

As an **INTJ**, I thrive on:
- 🧠 **Critical thinking**
- 🧩 **Rational problem-solving**
- 🤝 **Collaborating with teams** to build things that actually work (and don’t break on Fridays)

I'm passionate about:
- ☁️ Architecting scalable solutions in the **cloud**
- 💡 Tackling complex systems with clean, efficient code
- 🚀 Exploring new tech stacks just for fun (and maybe for the résumé too)

Always caffeinated, always curious, and always ready for the next big challenge—bonus points if it includes a clean Git history.
